<p>During this semester we got to experiment with the bio python functions on python. Having worked in neurology labs that analyze DNA sequences, I found these tools especially helpful to learn. One such function we experimented with was creating a dictionary containing 3mers in a DNA string.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>my_seq1 = &quot;ATCATCATG&quot;
my_seq2 = &quot;CAGCCCAATCAGGCTCTACTGCCACTAAACTTACGCAGGATATATTTACGCCGACGTACT&quot;

def kmer_count(seq, k):
    f = {}
    for x in range(len(seq)+1-k):
        kmer = seq[x:x+k]
        f[kmer] = f.get(kmer, 0) + 1
    return(f)

kmer_count(my_seq1,3)
</code></pre>
